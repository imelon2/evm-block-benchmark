## 📋 Overview
This repo provides an easy-to-use web interface to benchmark EVM-compatible blockchains. The UI allows you to input a `Provider URL` and specify a `block range`, and it will automatically collect and display essential data like:
- Block per data
- Elapsed time and Transactions Per Second (TPS)
- Average of gas price
- Total transactions count and total used fee

Additionally, the results are visualized with interactive charts powered by [`echarts.js`](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html), offering a clear and intuitive way to analyze blockchain performance.

You can quickly access and use the tool directly via the following link:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to GitHub Pages policies, the blockchain RPC provider URL must use either HTTPS or localhost.
